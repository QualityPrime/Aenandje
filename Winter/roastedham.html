						<p class="introduction">

    Place the gammon in a large, snug-fitting pot and cover with water. Roughly chop and throw in the carrots and celery, with the bay leaves, peppercorns and bouquet garni. Peel the zest from the oranges and add to the water, then squeeze the juice.
    Place the pot over a high heat, bring to the boil, then turn the heat down and simmer for 1 hour 15 minutes with a lid on, skimming away any scum that rises to the surface, as and when needed.
    When the time's up, remove from the heat and allow to cool for half an hour in the broth - this will allow the flavours to really penetrate the meat.
    Preheat the oven to 170 C/325 F/gas 3.
    Carefully remove the meat to a board and, using a knife, take off the skin. Depending on the breed and quality of the pig, you should have a nice layer of fat. Remove some of the fat as well, to leave you with about 1cm. The extra fat can be kept in the freezer for roasting with potatoes another time.
    Score the fat left on the meat in a criss-cross fashion, and season generously with 3 tablespoons of black pepper.
    Place the ham in a roasting tray and roast for 20 minutes, or until the fat renders and becomes slightly crispy.
    Remove from the oven, stir the marmalade to loosen, then rub it all over the meat, and strip over the rosemary.
    Return to the oven for about 1 hour and baste frequently until beautifully golden and crisp. Serve as you would a roast dinner or as part of a picnic.
