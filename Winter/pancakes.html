					<h1 class="description">PREPERATION:</h1> 
						<p class="introduction"> To make the batter, crack the egg into a large mixing bowl. 
						Add the flour, milk and a tiny pinch of sea salt. Whisk everything together until you have a lovely, smooth batter.
						 Fold through the blueberries, if using.
						 Put a large frying pan on a medium heat and after a minute or so, add half tablespoon of oil. 
						 Carefully tilt the pan to spread the oil out evenly. Add a few ladles of batter to the pan, leaving enough space between each one so they have room to spread out slightly - each ladleful will make one pancake, and you'll need to cook them in batches. 
						 Cook the pancakes for 1 to 2 minutes, or until little bubbles appear on the surface and the bases are golden, then use a fish slice to carefully flip them over. When the pancakes are golden on both sides, use a fish slice to transfer the pancakes to a plate. 
						 Repeat steps 5 to 9 with the remaining batter, adding half tablespoon of oil to the pan between batches, if needed. Serve the pancakes straight away, topped with a dollop of natural yoghurt, and some extra berries, if you like.
